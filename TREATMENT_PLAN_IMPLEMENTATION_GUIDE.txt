=============================================================================
1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
=============================================================================

The Treatment Plan system is the core of HealSync that connects doctors and patients 
through structured medical treatment workflows. Here's how it works:

CORE CONCEPT:
- Doctors create treatment plans for specific patients
- Each treatment plan addresses a specific disease/condition
- Treatment plans contain multiple prescribed medicines
- Patients can view their treatment plans and manage medications
- System tracks treatment progress and maintains medical history

KEY ENTITIES:
- TreatmentPlan: The main treatment record
- TreatmentMedicine: Individual medicine prescriptions within a plan
- Patient: Who receives the treatment
- Doctor: Who creates the treatment plan
- Disease: What condition is being treated
- Medicine: What medications are prescribed

=============================================================================
2. DATABASE STRUCTURE & RELATIONSHIPS
=============================================================================

TreatmentPlan Table:
-------------------
treatmentId (Primary Key) - Unique identifier for each treatment plan
patientId (Foreign Key) - Links to Patient table
doctorId (Foreign Key) - Links to Doctor table  
diseaseId (Foreign Key) - Links to Disease table
status - 'Active', 'Completed', 'Paused', 'Cancelled'
startDate - When treatment begins
endDate - When treatment ends (optional)
notes - Doctor's treatment instructions and notes

TreatmentMedicine Table:
-----------------------
treatmentMedID (Primary Key) - Unique identifier for each medicine prescription
treatmentID (Foreign Key) - Links to TreatmentPlan table
medicineName - Name of the prescribed medicine
dosage - How much to take (e.g., "500mg", "2 tablets")
timing - When to take (e.g., "Twice daily with meals", "Before breakfast")

RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM:
Patient (1) ←→ (Many) TreatmentPlan ←→ (Many) TreatmentMedicine
Doctor (1) ←→ (Many) TreatmentPlan
Disease (1) ←→ (Many) TreatmentPlan
Medicine (1) ←→ (Many) TreatmentMedicine

=============================================================================
3. API ENDPOINTS & DATA FLOW
=============================================================================

MAIN API ENDPOINT:
POST /api/patients/{patientId}/treatment-plans
- Creates a new treatment plan for a specific patient
- Accepts treatment details and list of medicines
- Returns complete treatment plan with generated IDs

REQUEST FORMAT:
{
  "doctorId": 1,
  "diseaseId": 2,
  "status": "Active",
  "notes": "Take medicines regularly. Follow up in 2 weeks.",
  "medicines": [
    {
      "medicineId": 1,
      "dosage": "500mg",
      "timing": "Morning and Evening after meals"
    },
    {
      "medicineId": 2,
      "dosage": "250mg", 
      "timing": "Once daily before breakfast"
    }
  ]
}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
{
  "treatmentId": 1,
  "patientId": 1,
  "doctorId": 1,
  "diseaseId": 2,
  "status": "Active",
  "startDate": "2025-08-04",
  "notes": "Take medicines regularly. Follow up in 2 weeks.",
  "medicines": [
    {
      "treatmentMedID": 1,
      "medicineName": "Paracetamol",
      "dosage": "500mg",
      "timing": "Morning and Evening after meals"
    },
    {
      "treatmentMedID": 2,
      "medicineName": "Aspirin",
      "dosage": "250mg",
      "timing": "Once daily before breakfast"
    }
  ]
}

=============================================================================
4. FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
=============================================================================

The frontend should have TWO main interfaces:

A) DOCTOR INTERFACE - Treatment Plan Creation
B) PATIENT INTERFACE - Treatment Plan Viewing & Management

DOCTOR WORKFLOW:
1. Doctor logs in and sees patient list
2. Doctor selects a patient to treat
3. Doctor creates treatment plan by:
   - Selecting the disease/condition
   - Adding treatment notes
   - Selecting medicines from database
   - Specifying dosage and timing for each medicine
4. Doctor submits the treatment plan
5. System saves and assigns treatment plan ID
6. Doctor can view/edit treatment plans later

PATIENT WORKFLOW:
1. Patient logs in and sees dashboard
2. Patient views "My Treatment Plans" section
3. Patient sees all active/past treatment plans
4. For each treatment plan, patient can:
   - View doctor's notes
   - See prescribed medicines with dosages
   - Set medicine reminders
   - Mark medicines as taken
   - Track treatment progress

=============================================================================
5. USER INTERFACE COMPONENTS
=============================================================================

DOCTOR'S TREATMENT CREATION FORM:
================================

Components Needed:
- Patient Selection Dropdown
- Disease Selection Dropdown  
- Status Selection (Active/Paused/Completed)
- Treatment Notes Text Area
- Dynamic Medicine List (Add/Remove medicines)
- Medicine Selection Dropdown (for each medicine)
- Dosage Input Field (for each medicine)
- Timing Input Field (for each medicine)
- Submit Button

Form Validation:
- Patient must be selected
- Disease must be selected
- At least one medicine must be added
- Each medicine must have dosage and timing
- Treatment notes should not be empty

PATIENT'S TREATMENT VIEW:
========================

Components Needed:
- Treatment Plan Cards Grid
- Treatment Plan Details Modal
- Medicine List with Details
- Medicine Reminder Settings
- Treatment Status Indicators
- Doctor Contact Information
- Treatment Progress Tracker

Data Display:
- Treatment Plan ID and dates
- Doctor name and specialty
- Disease/condition being treated
- Treatment status with color coding
- Complete medicine list with schedules
- Doctor's notes and instructions

=============================================================================
6. STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION
=============================================================================

STEP 1: SETUP FRONTEND COMPONENTS
=================================

Create React Components:
- CreateTreatmentPlan.tsx (Doctor interface)
- ViewTreatmentPlans.tsx (Patient interface)
- TreatmentPlanCard.tsx (Individual plan display)
- MedicineRow.tsx (Medicine input row)
- TreatmentDetailsModal.tsx (Detailed view popup)

Install Required Libraries:
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Date picker for scheduling
- Notification library for reminders

STEP 2: CREATE DOCTOR INTERFACE
===============================

Doctor Form Fields:
```
Patient Selection: [Dropdown with patient names]
Disease Selection: [Dropdown with disease list]  
Treatment Status: [Dropdown: Active/Paused/Completed]
Treatment Notes: [Large text area for instructions]

Medicine Section:
- Medicine 1: [Medicine Dropdown] [Dosage Input] [Timing Input] [Remove Button]
- Medicine 2: [Medicine Dropdown] [Dosage Input] [Timing Input] [Remove Button]
[Add Medicine Button]

[Create Treatment Plan Button]
```

Form Logic:
- Load patients, diseases, and medicines from API on component mount
- Dynamically add/remove medicine rows
- Validate all required fields before submission
- Show success/error messages after API call
- Reset form after successful submission

STEP 3: CREATE PATIENT INTERFACE
================================

Patient Dashboard Layout:
```
My Treatment Plans
==================

[Active Treatment Plans]
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Treatment Plan #123                 │
│ Doctor: Dr. John Smith              │
│ Condition: Diabetes                 │
│ Status: ACTIVE                      │
│                                     │
│ Medicines:                          │
│ • Metformin 500mg - Twice daily     │
│ • Insulin 10 units - Before meals   │
│                                     │
│ [View Details] [Set Reminders]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

[Past Treatment Plans]
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Treatment Plan #122                 │

│ [View Details]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

STEP 4: IMPLEMENT API INTEGRATION
=================================

API Service Functions:
```javascript
// api/treatmentPlan.js

export const createTreatmentPlan = async (patientId, treatmentData) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/patients/${patientId}/treatment-plans`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(treatmentData)
  });
  return response.json();
};

export const getPatientTreatmentPlans = async (patientId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/patients/${patientId}/treatment-plans`);
  return response.json();
};

export const getPatients = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/patients');
  return response.json();
};

export const getDiseases = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/diseases');
  return response.json();
};

export const getMedicines = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/medicines');
  return response.json();
};
```

=============================================================================
7. DATA FLOW EXAMPLES
=============================================================================

SCENARIO 1: DOCTOR CREATES TREATMENT PLAN
=========================================

1. Doctor Interface Loading:
   - Frontend calls GET /api/patients to populate patient dropdown
   - Frontend calls GET /api/diseases to populate disease dropdown
   - Frontend calls GET /api/medicines to populate medicine dropdowns

2. Doctor Fills Form:
   - Selects "John Doe (ID: 123)" from patient dropdown
   - Selects "Diabetes" from disease dropdown
   - Sets status to "Active"
   - Enters notes: "Monitor blood glucose daily"
   - Adds Medicine 1: Metformin, 500mg, "Twice daily with meals"
   - Adds Medicine 2: Insulin, 10 units, "Before breakfast"

3. Form Submission:
   - Frontend validates all fields are filled
   - Frontend calls POST /api/patients/123/treatment-plans with:
     {
       "doctorId": 456,
       "diseaseId": 789,
       "status": "Active",
       "notes": "Monitor blood glucose daily",
       "medicines": [
         {"medicineId": 101, "dosage": "500mg", "timing": "Twice daily with meals"},
         {"medicineId": 102, "dosage": "10 units", "timing": "Before breakfast"}
       ]
     }

4. Backend Processing:
   - Validates patient exists
   - Creates TreatmentPlan record (gets treatmentId: 999)
   - Creates TreatmentMedicine records:
     * Record 1: treatmentID=999, medicineName="Metformin", dosage="500mg", timing="Twice daily with meals"
     * Record 2: treatmentID=999, medicineName="Insulin", dosage="10 units", timing="Before breakfast"
   - Returns complete treatment plan data

5. Frontend Response:
   - Shows success message: "Treatment Plan #999 created successfully!"
   - Resets form for next treatment plan
   - Optionally redirects to treatment plan details page

SCENARIO 2: PATIENT VIEWS TREATMENT PLANS
=========================================

1. Patient Login:
   - Patient logs in with credentials
   - System identifies patient (patientId: 123)
   - Frontend redirects to patient dashboard

2. Dashboard Loading:
   - Frontend calls GET /api/patients/123/treatment-plans
   - Backend fetches all treatment plans for patient 123
   - Backend joins with TreatmentMedicine table to get complete data

3. Data Display:
   - Frontend receives array of treatment plans
   - Each plan includes complete medicine list
   - Frontend renders treatment plan cards
   - Each card shows: plan details + medicines + status

4. Patient Interactions:
   - Patient clicks "View Details" → Opens modal with full treatment info
   - Patient clicks "Set Reminders" → Opens reminder configuration
   - Patient can mark medicines as taken (if implemented)

=============================================================================
8. ERROR HANDLING & VALIDATION
=============================================================================

FRONTEND VALIDATION:
===================

Required Field Checks:
- Patient must be selected (patientId > 0)
- Disease must be selected (diseaseId > 0) 
- At least one medicine must be added
- Each medicine must have non-empty dosage and timing
- Treatment notes should have minimum length

Real-time Validation:
- Highlight invalid fields in red
- Show error messages below invalid inputs
- Disable submit button until all validations pass
- Show character count for text areas

API Error Handling:
- Network errors: Show "Connection failed" message
- 400 Bad Request: Show field-specific validation errors
- 404 Not Found: Show "Patient/Disease/Medicine not found"
- 500 Server Error: Show "System error, please try again"

BACKEND VALIDATION:
==================

Data Integrity Checks:
- Verify patient exists before creating treatment plan
- Verify doctor exists and is authorized
- Verify disease exists in database
- Verify all medicine IDs are valid
- Check for duplicate active treatment plans (if business rule)

Database Constraints:
- Foreign key constraints prevent invalid references
- Status field restricted to valid values
- Date validation for treatment dates
- Text length limits for notes and instructions

=============================================================================
9. TESTING SCENARIOS
=============================================================================

DOCTOR INTERFACE TESTING:
========================

Test Case 1: Successful Treatment Plan Creation
- Select valid patient, disease, add medicines
- Submit form
- Verify success message and form reset
- Check database for created records

Test Case 2: Form Validation
- Try submitting with missing patient → Should show error
- Try submitting with no medicines → Should show error
- Try submitting with incomplete medicine info → Should show error

Test Case 3: Medicine Management
- Add multiple medicines → Should create multiple rows
- Remove medicine → Should remove specific row
- Modify medicine details → Should update form state

PATIENT INTERFACE TESTING:
=========================

Test Case 1: Treatment Plan Display
- Login as patient with treatment plans
- Verify all plans are displayed correctly
- Check medicine lists are complete
- Verify status indicators work

Test Case 2: Empty State
- Login as patient with no treatment plans
- Verify appropriate "no plans" message
- Check all interface elements render correctly

Test Case 3: Treatment Plan Details
- Click "View Details" on treatment plan
- Verify modal opens with complete information
- Check all medicine details are visible
- Test modal close functionality

API TESTING:
===========

Test Case 1: Valid Treatment Plan Creation
POST /api/patients/1/treatment-plans with valid data
Expected: 200 OK with complete treatment plan response

Test Case 2: Invalid Patient ID
POST /api/patients/999/treatment-plans with valid data
Expected: 404 "Patient not found"

Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields
POST /api/patients/1/treatment-plans with incomplete data
Expected: 400 Bad Request with validation errors
